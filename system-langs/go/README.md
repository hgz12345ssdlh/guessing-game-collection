# Guessing Game in Go

> I'm not strictly following the GOPATH workspace rules. PS: Forcing a unified workspace is not the way I like. Rust's way of managing paths makes me feel more comfortable.

To play:

```bash
$ export GOPATH=$( pwd )    # Unstandard.
$ go build -o game
$ ./game
$ unset GOPATH              # Unstandard.
```
